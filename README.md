As a freelance coder, your team is assigned to develop a Student Information Management 
System. The proposed system should be able to perform the following operations:

1. Add a new student record including student ID, student name, and marks for Test 1, 
Test 2 and final assessment.
2. Modify the student's record.
3. View all student records with their total mark (Test 1 + Test 2 + Final Assessment).
4. Save all data into a file that includes a summary of:
i. the total number of students.
ii. the highest, lowest, and average marks for Test 1 and Test 2 respectively.
iii. the total marks for all students.
