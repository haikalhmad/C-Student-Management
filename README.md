As a freelance coder, your team is assigned to develop a Student Information Management 
System. The proposed system should be able to perform the following operations:

1. Add a new student record including student ID, student name, and marks for Test 1, 
Test 2 and final assessment.
2. Modify the student's record.
3. View all student records with their total mark (Test 1 + Test 2 + Final Assessment).
4. Save all data into a file that includes a summary of:
i. the total number of students.
ii. the highest, lowest, and average marks for Test 1 and Test 2 respectively.
iii. the total marks for all students.

Your proposed system must use a C++ program and it should:
a) Contain all topics covered in the class (screen input and output, arithmetic operations, 
control flow, function, array/vector, pointer, structure/class, file processing)
b) Running continuously during the presentation without having to run a new program 
for each summarization.
